# circleexplorer

CircleExplorer is a simple, but an extendable prototype for a virtual building block setup to teach young children the basics of quantitative reasoning. Using an intuitive drag-and-drop system, groups of circles can be added to each other in differing ways. In addition, these groups can be easily created, disposed of, and resized easily. This program also can be used by newcomers to the field of Computer Science, as it utilizes many concepts including two-dimensional arrays and object-oriented programming. In the future, tutorials, challenges, and advanced tools can be added in.

(Idk about anyone else, but this is also fun to play with.)
